                <h1>Early Life</h1>
                <span><b>Bhagat Singh</b> was born into a Jat Sikh family to Kishan Singh and Vidyavati. The exact date
                    of his birth remains a topic of debate, with sources differing between September 27 and September
                    28, 1907. His
                    desire to fight against the British was inspired by his family’s involvement in the freedom
                    struggle, in which his grandfather, father, and uncles actively participated. In fact, his father
                    and one of his uncles were in prison when he was born. Singh attended the local primary school in
                    Lyallpur before moving to Lahore. There he attended Dayanand Anglo Vedic High School, which was
                    operated by the Arya Samaj (a reform sect of modern Hinduism), and then the National College.
